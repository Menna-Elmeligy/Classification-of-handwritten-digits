# Description
This project uses pytorch to classify MNIST handwritten-digits datasets. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. This project serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the basics of neural network design and implementation.
## Introduction
In this project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the MNIST dataset.

Some of the benchmark results on MNIST include can be found on _Yann LeCun's_ page and include:

* 88% Lecun et al., 1998
* 95.3% Lecun et al., 1998
* 99.65% Ciresan et al., 2011

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
  `jupyter notebook MNIST_Handwritten_Digits-STARTER.ipynb`

2. **Follow the steps in the notebook** to load the data, build the neural network, and train it.

## Results
The notebook guides you through building and training a neural network on the MNIST dataset. You will be able to compare your model's performance with benchmark results.
